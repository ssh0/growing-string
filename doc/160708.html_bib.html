  abstract = {Colonies of bacteria,Bacillus subtilis, that grow on
                 the surface of thin agar plates show various
                 morphological patterns in response to environmental
                 conditions, such as the nutrient concentration, the
                 solidity of an agar medium and temperature. For
                 instance, the colony pattern shows a dense-branching
                 morphology with a smooth circular envelope (DBM-like)
                 in a nutrient-poor semi-solid agar medium, and it turns
                 to a simple disk-like colony as both the nutrient
                 concentration and the agar's softness increase. These
                 patterns have been shown to involve cell movement
                 inside colonies. In a DBM-like colony, individual cells
                 actively move, particularly in the expanding periphery
                 of the colony, while they become immotile at the inner
                 region of the colony where nutrient is very low. In a
                 disk-like colony, cells are highly active in the whole
                 region of the colony. Based on such experimental
                 observations, we develop a diffusion-reaction model, in
                 which density dependent cell movements are incorporated
                 by the level of nutrient concentration available for
                 the cell. Numerical simulations of the model under
                 different environmental conditions closely reproduce
                 various colony patterns ranging from DBM-like pattern
                 to the homogeneous disk-like one in a unifying manner.
                 The analysis also predicts the growth velocity of a
                 colony as a function of the nutrient concentration.}
